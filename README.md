## Features

1.The Participation Forum module is a customized forum designed to engage students in a collaborative online discussion as a formative learning activity. It creates a required activity worth up to 10 points, which the students can earn by participating in the discussion. It has three primary features:
The “Add a new group post” button creates “semi-private” areas for discussions by small groups of students (size 3 to 8 is recommended)
2.It appends detailed task design instructions (below the forum topic questions) which describe the types of posts expected:
   a.Group post
   b.First post by each student
   c.Questions
   d.Answers
   e.Reflective post
3.It automatically generates a rating of participation based on the level of activity by each student (up to 10 points available) and stores it in the course Gradebook
